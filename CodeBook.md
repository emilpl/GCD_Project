Code book for the GCD_Project

The features selected for this database are mean (denoted as Mean) and standard deviation 
(denoted as StDev) values of the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals. 
These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 
50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth 
filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. 
The mean and standard deviation of the separated acceleration signal are also presented. 
The acceleration signal was separated into body and gravity acceleration signals 
(timeBodyAcc-Mean/StDev-XYZ and timeGravityAccMean-XYZ) using another low pass 
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.
